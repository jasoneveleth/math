# this is a problem

dsjlka fjkdl jfdsjf dslak I have some text here tha tis just supposed to be
cannon fodder. $400 is teh price I'm willing to pay.

This is another paragraph but this has $4x = 10x^2$. That should be a
formula. If it isn't that's a problem. Now, I want an even trickier thing: $3 =
54x - 5x^2$ that was split over two lines. Now for the kicker. 
$$ \sum_{k=0}^m n^k = \frac{n-2}{m} .$$ That was non inline hopefully.

A final conclusioin paragraph.
